However, with great modularity comes great complexity—especially when it comes to managing <strong>data consistency across services</strong>.</p><p>Imagine you’re booking a flight ticket: the order service must create your booking, the payment service must process your payment, and the inventory service must update the available seats. What happens if the payment fails after the booking is created? Or the inventory update fails after payment is successful? How do you keep all these distributed systems in sync without corrupting data or leaving the system in a broken state?</p><p>Traditional solutions like <strong>distributed transactions</strong> (e.g., Two-Phase Commit or 2PC) try to solve this but come with significant drawbacks — they’re complicated, block resources, and often don’t scale well in highly distributed environments.</p><p>The <strong>Saga Pattern</strong> offers a smarter, more scalable way. It manages distributed transactions by <strong>breaking a big transaction into a series of smaller, local transactions</strong>, each handled by a separate service. When something goes wrong, sagas roll back previous steps by executing compensating transactions, ensuring data consistency without locking resources or relying on complex distributed locks.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll dive deep into how the Saga Pattern works, explore its two main types — choreography and orchestration — and walk through a practical example to show how sagas can solve real-world challenges like user registration and ticket booking.</p><h2><strong>What is the Saga Pattern?</strong></h2><p>The Saga Pattern is a design approach to maintain <strong>eventual consistency</strong> in a distributed system by splitting a large transaction into multiple, smaller, atomic transactions executed by individual microservices.</p><p>- Each microservice performs a local transaction.</p><p>- If any step fails, the system triggers compensating transactions to undo the previous successful steps.</p><p>- Instead of locking resources across services, sagas embrace failure and recovery as part of the process.</p><p>This approach avoids the pitfalls of distributed transactions, improves system availability, and aligns perfectly with the loosely coupled nature of microservices.</p><h2><strong>Types of Saga</strong></h2><h3>1. Choreography (Event-Driven Saga)</h3><p>In the choreography style, there is <strong>no central coordinator</strong>. Each service listens for events emitted by other services and reacts accordingly.</p><p>- When a service completes its local transaction, it publishes an event.</p><p>- Other interested services listen to these events and perform their own transactions.</p><p>- If something fails, a service emits a compensating event to rollback previous transactions.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>- Simple to implement for straightforward workflows.</p><p>- Decentralized, no single point of failure.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>- Hard to track and debug complex flows.</p><p>- The overall saga logic is spread across services.</p><p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/blog-content/1748739141554_choreoghraphy.png\" alt=\"Choreograhpy\" width=\"720px\"></p><h3>2. Orchestration (Centralized Saga)</h3><p>Here, a <strong>dedicated orchestrator service</strong> explicitly controls the saga flow:</p><p>- It calls each service in sequence.</p><p>- Waits for success or failure response.</p><p>- Triggers compensating transactions if needed.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>- Clear central control and visibility.</p><p>- Easier to monitor, debug, and audit.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>- Orchestrator is a potential single point of failure.</p><p>- Slightly more complex infrastructure.</p><p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/blog-content/1748739138524_Orchestrator.png\" alt=\"Orchestrator\" width=\"720px\"></p><h2>Real-World Example: User Registration with Saga Orchestration</h2><h3><strong>Scenario</strong></h3><p>A user signs up for a service where:</p><p>- The <strong>Login Service</strong> manages authentication.</p><p>- The <strong>Coupon System</strong> sets up user rewards eligibility.</p><p>Both must succeed for a successful registration; otherwise, actions must be rolled back to avoid inconsistency.</p><h3><strong>Services Involved</strong></h3><p>In this user registration saga, three key services collaborate to ensure a smooth and consistent registration process. The <strong>Login Service</strong> is responsible for handling user authentication by managing credentials such as username and password. The <strong>Coupon System</strong> service manages user rewards by creating and maintaining profiles that determine eligibility for coupons and incentives. Coordinating these two services is the <strong>Saga Orchestrator</strong>, a dedicated service that controls the entire multi-step registration flow, ensuring each step completes successfully and triggering compensations if any step fails.</p><p>Alternatively, here are the services as clear points:</p><p><strong>- Login Service:</strong> Handles user authentication and credential management.</p><p><strong>- Coupon System:</strong> Sets up user profiles and manages coupon eligibility.</p><p><strong>- Saga Orchestrator:</strong> Controls and coordinates the entire multi-step registration process.</p><p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/blog-content/1748739132016_mermaid%20diagram%20saga%20orchestrator.png\" alt=\"workflow\" width=\"720px\"></p><p>- The client sends a registration request to the orchestrator.</p><p>- Orchestrator requests Login Service to register the user.</p><p>- On success, orchestrator calls Coupon System to create a user profile.</p><p>- If coupon creation fails, orchestrator compensates by deleting the user in the Login Service.</p><p>- The orchestrator returns the final success or failure response to the client.</p><h3><strong>Simple Implementation Example (Node.js + Express + Axios)</strong></h3><div><pre><code>// Orchestrator service\napp.post(\"/register\", async (req, res) =&gt; {\n&nbsp; const { username, password, ...profileData } = req.body;\n\n&nbsp; try {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; // Step 1: Register user in Login Service\n&nbsp; &nbsp; const loginRes = await axios.post(\"https://login/api/register\", {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; username,\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; password,\n&nbsp; &nbsp; });\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; // Step 2: Create user profile in Coupon System\n&nbsp; &nbsp; await axios.post(\"https://coupon/api/user\", {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; userId: loginRes.data.userId,\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...profileData,\n&nbsp; &nbsp; });\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; res.status(201).json({ success: true });\n&nbsp; } catch (err) {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; // Compensation if coupon system fails\n&nbsp; &nbsp; if (err.response?.config?.url?.includes(\"/coupon/api/user\")) {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await axios.delete(`https://login/api/user/${username}`);\n&nbsp; &nbsp; }\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: \"Registration failed\" });\n&nbsp; }\n});\n</code></pre></div><h2><strong>Key Considerations for Implementing Sagas</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Idempotency:</strong> Ensure operations such as user creation or deletion can be safely retried without causing duplicate or inconsistent data.</p><p><strong>2. Retry:</strong> Implement retry mechanisms or queues to handle transient failures and avoid immediate aborts.</p><p><strong>3. Observability:</strong> Log every step and its outcome to help with tracing, debugging, and monitoring saga executions.</p><p><strong>4. Compensation:</strong> Design reversible compensating actions for every transactional step to undo changes if subsequent steps fail.</p><h2><strong>Pros and Cons of the Saga Pattern</strong></h2><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>- Scales naturally and fits well with microservices architectures.</p><p>- Handles partial failures gracefully through compensation.</p><p>- Supports eventual consistency without blocking resources.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>- Compensation logic can become complex and hard to maintain.</p><p>- Debugging failures in distributed, event-driven flows is challenging.</p><p>- Requires careful design to ensure all steps and compensations are idempotent and reliable.</p><h2><strong>Tools and Platforms to Implement Sagas</strong></h2><p>You don’t have to build saga orchestration and choreography logic from scratch. Several mature tools and platforms provide robust support for managing distributed workflows and sagas:</p><p><strong>1. Temporal.io:</strong> A powerful open-source workflow orchestration engine designed for microservices. It handles retries, state persistence, compensation, and observability out of the box.</p><p><strong>2. AWS Step Functions:</strong> A fully managed service that lets you coordinate components of distributed applications using visual workflows. It supports saga patterns with built-in error handling and retries.</p><p><strong>3. Camunda:</strong> A popular open-source workflow and decision automation platform that can model, execute, and monitor sagas with BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation).</p><p><strong>4. Apache Airflow:</strong> Although primarily for data workflows, it can be adapted to manage saga-style orchestrations with retries and compensations.</p><p><strong>5. Netflix Conductor:</strong> A microservices orchestration engine used for running complex asynchronous workflows and sagas at scale.</p><p><strong>6. EventBridge (AWS) or Kafka:</strong> Event buses and streaming platforms that enable event-driven choreography sagas by reliably passing events between services.</p><p>Using these platforms can significantly reduce the complexity of building, maintaining, and monitoring sagas in production environments, letting you focus on your business logic rather than workflow plumbing.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>The Saga Pattern transforms the way we think about transactions in distributed systems. By accepting failure as inevitable and designing compensating actions, sagas enable microservices to maintain <strong>data consistency without sacrificing scalability or availability</strong>.</p><p>Whether you use choreography for simple event-driven flows or orchestration for fine-grained control, sagas are essential for building resilient, fault-tolerant microservices.</p><p>With proper implementation—strong observability, idempotency, and retry logic—sagas can empower your architecture to handle complexity with confidence and keep your data consistent across service boundaries.</p>","timestamp":"Sunday, June 1, 2025 at 9:15:17 AM GMT+8","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/blog-content/1748738206746_saga%20pattern.jfif","image_alt":"Saga Pattern","slug":"Saga-Pattern-in-Microservices-Architecture","index":"d4735e3a265e1","tags":["Software Architecture","Distributed Systems","Microservices"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"blog_id":"52acda91-39c3-4ea5-8ba0-ad616298fad1","title":"Understanding Event Sourcing with a Digital Wallet Case Study","short_description":"Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern where every change to an application's state is stored as an immutable event, rather than just storing the final state.

","description":"<p>Managing traffic is crucial for keeping systems reliable and stable, especially when handling a high volume of requests. Two techniques often come up in this context: <strong>rate limiting</strong> and <strong>throttling</strong>. But what do they mean, how do they differ, and when should you use each? Let’s break it down in a simple, practical way with visuals and a hands-on example.</p><h2><strong>What Are They?</strong></h2><p><strong>- Rate Limiting</strong>: This sets a hard cap on the number of requests a user can make within a specific time frame. It’s about <em>how much</em> a user can do. For example, you might allow 60 API requests per minute—once that limit is hit, further requests are rejected until the window resets.</p><p><strong>- Throttling</strong>: This controls the speed at which requests are made, ensuring they come at a manageable pace. It’s about <em>how fast</em> a user can make requests. Instead of rejecting requests, throttling delays them to smooth out the traffic flow.</p><h2><strong>A Simple Analogy</strong></h2><p>To make this clearer, let’s use an analogy:</p><p><strong>- Rate Limiting</strong>: Imagine a shop that only allows 100 customers per hour. Once the 100th customer enters, the door locks, and no one else can enter until the next hour begins. It’s a strict limit on total volume.</p><p><strong>- Throttling</strong>: Picture the same shop, but this time, it lets in one customer every 2 seconds. Even if the shop is empty, you have to wait your turn. This controls the pace of entry, ensuring a steady flow without sudden spikes.</p><p>Both techniques manage access, but they focus on different aspects: total volume versus speed of entry.</p><h2><strong>Real-World Examples</strong></h2><p>Let’s look at how these concepts apply in practice:</p><p><strong>- Rate Limiting Example</strong>:</p><p>Your API allows 60 requests per minute. If a client sends 60 requests in just 30 seconds, they’ve hit the cap. For the next 30 seconds, any additional requests are rejected with a 429 Too Many Requests error. After the minute is up, the limit resets, and the client can start again.</p><p><strong>- Throttling Example</strong>:</p><p>Now imagine your API allows 1 request every 500 milliseconds. If a client sends 3 requests in 100ms, the 2nd and 3rd requests aren’t rejected—they’re delayed. The system spaces out the requests evenly, slowing the client down without denying access.</p><h2><strong>How They Behave Technically</strong></h2><p><strong>- Rate Limiting</strong>: Think of it as a strict bouncer at a club. If you hit the limit, you’re locked out, and you’ll get a 429 error. It’s a hard stop.</p><p><strong>- Throttling</strong>: This is more like a traffic light. You might have to wait, but you’re not denied entry—just delayed until the system can handle your request.</p><h2><strong>Common Algorithms</strong></h2><p><strong>- Rate Limiting</strong>: Often uses algorithms like Fixed Window (e.g., 60 requests per minute) or Token Bucket (where tokens represent available requests).</p><p><strong>- Throttling</strong>: Typically relies on Leaky Bucket (processing requests at a steady rate) or Token Bucket with interval logic to enforce delays.</p><h2>Visualizing the Difference</h2><p>Let’s use diagrams to see how these mechanisms work in action.</p><h3><strong>Rate Limiting Diagram</strong></h3><p>The diagram below shows a \"Rate Limiter\" handling incoming requests from multiple users. Green arrows represent accepted requests that reach the server, while red arrows indicate dropped requests. This illustrates a hard cap—once the limit is reached, excess requests are rejected outright.</p><p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/blog-content/1749173548237_rate%20limiting.jpg\" alt=\"rate limiter diagram\" width=\"720px\"></p><h3><strong>Throttling Diagram</strong></h3><p>In this diagram, requests from various sources (laptop, mobile, application server) pass through an \"External API Throttling\" layer. The requests are categorized as \"slow\" or \"fast,\" and multi-instance servers handle them at different rates (e.g., 100/min for slow, 400/min for fast). This shows how throttling paces requests to avoid sudden spikes, ensuring a steady flow.</p><p><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/blog-content/1749173551601_throttling%20pattern.png\" alt=\"Throttling Diagram\" width=\"720px\"></p><h2><strong>When Should You Use Each?</strong></h2><h3>Use Rate Limiting When:</h3><p>1. You need to enforce a strict usage quota to ensure fair access for all users.</p><p>2. You want to prevent abuse or Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.</p><p>3. You need to protect downstream services from being overwhelmed by too many requests.</p><h3>Use Throttling When:</h3><p>1. You want to avoid sudden traffic spikes that could overload the system.</p><p>2. You need to smooth out the load to maintain consistent performance.</p><p>3. You want to ensure all users experience stable response times, even during high traffic.</p><p>In practice, many systems combine both techniques. For example, you might throttle to smooth out bursts of traffic and rate limit to enforce overall usage caps.</p><h2><strong>A Simple Implementation in Express.js</strong></h2><p>Let’s see how to implement basic rate limiting and throttling in Express.js. We’ll use the express-rate-limit package for rate limiting and a custom middleware for throttling.</p><div><pre><code>const express = require('express');\nconst rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');\nconst app = express();\n\n// Rate Limiting Middleware (60 requests per minute)\nconst rateLimiter = rateLimit({\n&nbsp; windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute\n&nbsp; max: 60, // Max 60 requests per window\n&nbsp; message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',\n});\n\n// Throttling Middleware (1 request every 500ms)\nconst throttle = (req, res, next) =&gt; {\n&nbsp; const now = Date.now();\n&nbsp; const lastRequest = req.session?.lastRequest || 0;\n&nbsp; const timeSinceLastRequest = now - lastRequest;\n\n&nbsp; if (timeSinceLastRequest &lt; 500) {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; const delay = 500 - timeSinceLastRequest;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; req.session.lastRequest = Date.now();\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; next();\n&nbsp; &nbsp; }, delay);\n&nbsp; } else {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; req.session.lastRequest = now;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; next();\n&nbsp; }\n};\n\n// Apply rate limiting to this route\napp.get('/rate-limited', rateLimiter, (req, res) =&gt; {\n&nbsp; res.send('Rate-limited route: Request accepted!');\n});\n\n// Apply throttling to this route\napp.get('/throttled', throttle, (req, res) =&gt; {\n&nbsp; res.send('Throttled route: Request processed!');\n});\n\n// Start the server\napp.listen(3000, () =&gt; {\n&nbsp; console.log('Server running on port 3000');\n});\n</code></pre></div><h3><strong>How It Works</strong></h3><p><strong>1. Rate Limiting</strong>: The /rate-limited route uses express-rate-limit to allow 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this, you’ll get a 429 error with the message \"Too many requests, please try again later.\"</p><p><strong>2. Throttling</strong>: The /throttled route enforces a 500ms delay between requests. If you send requests too quickly, they’re delayed, not rejected.</p><h3><strong>Note</strong></h3><p>This throttling implementation is basic and uses setTimeout, which isn’t ideal for production. For a production-ready solution, consider using a library like bottleneck for throttling. Also, this code assumes a session-like mechanism for tracking lastRequest—in a real app, you’d need to add session middleware or use a different approach (e.g., IP-based tracking).</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Here’s the key takeaway:</p><p><strong>- Rate Limiting</strong> controls the <em>total number</em> of requests, ensuring users don’t exceed a set quota.</p><p><strong>- Throttling</strong> controls the <em>pace</em> of requests, smoothing out traffic to prevent spikes.</p><p>Both are powerful tools for API design, system protection, and maintaining quality of service. Whether you’re building a small app or a large-scale system, understanding and applying these techniques can make a big difference in performance and reliability.</p><p>If you’d like to explore implementations in other frameworks like Next.js or Nginx, feel free to dive deeper into those topics!</p>","timestamp":"Friday, June 6, 2025 at 9:44:49 AM GMT+8","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/personal-blog-darmajr.appspot.com/blog-content/1749173075136_throttling%20or%20rate%20limiting.jpg","image_alt":"Throttling vs Rate Limiting","slug":"Throttling-vs-Rate-Limiting-Whats-the-Difference-and-When-to-Use-Each","index":"d4735e3a265e1","tags":["API","Software Development","Throttling","Rate Limiting"]},"recommendedPosts":[{"blog_id":"aa6d33ed-f439-4fa4-9109-38427155b685","title":"Creating a Reusable React Layout Package via GitHub (Without npm Publish)","short_description":"If you often reuse the same Navbar, Footer, or other layout components across multiple React projects, maintaining them in each repo becomes redundant and error-prone.
